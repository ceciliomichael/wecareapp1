# WeCare App Development Session Log

## Date: August 30, 2024

### Session Summary
Today's session focused on completing Phase 2 of the WeCare app implementation, which included creating employer-related screens and fixing authentication issues. We successfully implemented all the required screens for the employer section of the application and resolved a navigation issue in the login functionality.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Implemented Employer Screens for Phase 2:**
   - `JobPostingScreen`: Created a form for employers to post and edit job listings
   - `MyJobsScreen`: Implemented a screen to view, edit, and manage job postings
   - `ApplicationsScreen`: Developed a screen to review and respond to applications from helpers
   - `EmployerProfileScreen`: Built a profile viewer/editor for employers

2. **Fixed Integration Issues:**
   - Fixed linter errors in the newly created screens
   - Resolved dependency issues between components
   - Ensured proper passing of data between screens

3. **Enhanced Authentication Flow:**
   - Fixed a critical issue in the login screen where it wasn't navigating to the employer dashboard after successful authentication
   - Implemented proper loading state management with progress indicators
   - Added appropriate error handling for authentication failures
   - Added user type validation to ensure users log in with the correct account type

4. **UI Improvements:**
   - Enhanced loading indicators with proper sizing and colors
   - Implemented form validation and button state management
   - Created consistent UI styling across employer screens

### Implementation Details

- Used the existing `JobService`, `ApplicationService`, and `AuthService` services to manage data
- Leveraged the `JobCard` and `ApplicationCard` components for consistent display of data
- Implemented responsive layouts with proper loading states and error handling
- Followed the page-based organization approach as outlined in the implementation plan

### Next Steps for Future Sessions

1. **Phase 3: Helper Screens Development**
   - Create the helper dashboard and related screens
   - Implement job browsing and application functionality for helpers

2. **Phase 4: Messaging System**
   - Implement in-app messaging between helpers and employers
   - Create conversation threads and message displays

3. **Phase 5: Polish & Optimization**
   - Add search and filtering capabilities
   - Implement ratings and reviews
   - Optimize performance and user experience

### Learnings & Notes
- Local storage with SharedPreferences is effective for prototype development
- The application follows a clean architecture with separate models, services, and UI layers
- User authentication requires careful attention to user types and navigation paths
